# archive directory

This directory contains code that was not necessary for the current codebase. 
In the event that this code is necessary, it will already have been written and could be used as a reference or starting point. 
This code might be useful to future project members. 

This is only necessary as the project continues to rapidly develop. 
Before being deployed to the public, this directory should be reviewed and considered for deletion in order to minimize the size of the codebase.
