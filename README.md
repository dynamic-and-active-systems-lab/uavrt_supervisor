# UAV-RT Supervisor package

This ROS 2 Node is responsible for enacting user commands onto and monitoring the airspy_csdr_netcat processes, channelizer process, and uavrt_detector processes running on the companion computer. This oversight can be expanded to additional processes (e.g. uavrt_localizer process) in the future.

The development of this code was funded via National Science Foundation grant no. 2104570.
